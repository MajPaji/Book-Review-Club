## UX

This website makes it easier to find a book. 
Users will get to know various kinds of books through a user-friendly interface. 
Also, looking at other people's reviews could help to understand if the book is the 
right choice for them. On the other hand, this website could make a bookseller business-owner 
sell more books; this would be possible by creating a social media model website. 
People can share the books that they read and write a review about them.

This website consists of three main sections. 
In the main section, the home page, users can see different books, 
search for them, and create a user account for themselves. 
In the other section, the user page, users can make a user account and add a 
review about a book that likes to share with others. 
In each book section, people can read about the book and see other people's review. 

Here some user stories:

* As a book lover, this website helps me to find a book on the topic that I always 
wanted to read about it but did not have a proper reference to choose from.
* I am pleased that I can share my opinion about the book that I have read recently. 
Other people's feedback helps me to understand if I have the right conclusion.
* As a bookstore owner, I like the website because it can show people about different books and 
makes them interested in readings.
